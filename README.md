[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/joemccann/dillinger.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/joemccann/dillinger)

A2A(Azure to AWS or AWS to Azure) is a cli tool that provides you service mappings for the most of the cloud offerings across the platforms.

As a DevOps/SRE engineer who works multi-cloud, this handy tool gives the correct service mappings between Azure andÂ AWS.
This can be pretty useful who is new to any of the clouds or coming from experience with a specific cloud .

# Features!

  - Enter the service name and voila the corresponding service in the appropriate cloud platform is shown
  - Service name can be from any platform(AWS/Azure)
  - Don't need to go to https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/aws-professional/services everytime to check for mappings

* [Python] - Oh surprise!
